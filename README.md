# Survey-Form
on the first day of learning HTML and CSS via FreeCodeCamp

## Live Site
[See live on netlify] - 



##Code limitation
basic html - mainly fieldset,label,legend,select,option, and input as to what most survey use and limitation at hand.
basic css - only changing text color and background via using a random image which was putting it in body causing multiple of identical photo instead of one being in the background and attempt on centering the whole form to the page.

##Attempt
time = aproximently 4 hour~.
ideas = barely any was just trying to make one with no idea what it should be or planning it all out.
